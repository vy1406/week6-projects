Using CSS variables and animation, create the following glowing effect:


The balls halo should increase-decrease alternately, infinitely
You should only have one div in your HTML
The box-shadow property should be useful
Use some pretty flat UI colors
This could be used on a page as a nice indication that something is currently active, like a recording or even a loading screen.

Exercise 2

Read up about the transition property and re-create the above effect. However, instead of constant animation, make the glow occur when the mouse :hovers over the element.

Here's a more detailed documentation on transition - in general MDN is a more in-depth doc than W3.

Exercise 3

The classic hamburger - using a simple transition, recreate the following effect:


Of course, because this works on-click... you'll need some JS in there ;)

Hint: you'll want to use the overflow-x property to hide the text as the side navigation moves.

More Detailed Hint:

Extra challenge: use some animation to change the "burger" to an "X" when it's clicked, and back to a burger on the next click.
